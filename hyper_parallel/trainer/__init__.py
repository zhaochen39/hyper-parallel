"""Top-level training public API.

Rebuilt in stage 7 (05 §10.1): the trainer classes moved here from
``auto_models/trainer/`` (S7d). Exports are lazy so that importing the
package (e.g. for ``trainer.config`` or ``trainer.callbacks``) stays cheap
and does not pull the model/data stack until a trainer class is touched.
