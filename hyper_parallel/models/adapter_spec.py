"""adapter_spec: ModelAdapterSpec — the shared model-adapter data contract.

One ``ModelAdapterSpec`` per model family declares the architecture
identity and the family's adapter providers (structure replacements,
attention contract, checkpoint mapping, model-specific TP/CP/EP rules).
The generic builders receive the spec through ``models/registry.py`` —
they never branch on model class names themselves (05 §15.9 step 1,
adjust doc §4/§7.2). This module holds only the data contract, never
model-class-name branches.

Provider fields stay ``None`` until the family's adapter modules land
(Qwen3-MoE: replacements/attention in M2, distributed rules in M3).

    """Architecture identity + adapter providers for one model family.

    Attributes:
        architecture: HF ``config.architectures[0]`` (e.g.
            ``"Qwen3MoeForCausalLM"``); native (non-HF) models register
            their own model class name here.
        model_type: HF ``config.model_type`` (e.g. ``"qwen3_moe"``) — the
            registry lookup key.
        replacements: provider returning the family's module-replacement
            declarations (pointing at the generic high-performance
            ``modules`` entries — never re-implementing kernels).
        attention: provider returning the family's attention contract
            (parameter names, mask/cache/forward adaptation).
        checkpoint: provider returning family-specific checkpoint
            key/layout mappings, when the generic mapping is insufficient.
        context_parallel: provider returning the family's CP wrappers.
        expert_parallel: provider returning the family's EP compute
            factories.
        sharding_rules: provider returning the family's planner naming-rule
            overrides — ``[(pattern | [patterns], ParamRole), ...]`` checked
            before the default naming rules in Phase 1 (e.g. DeepSeek MLA's
            replicated down-projections). Lives here so the generic planner
            never carries per-family knowledge.
        loss: provider returning model-family output-loss adapters that must
            intercept the model before a full terminal output is materialized.
        dit: provider returning a DiT-family construction adapter. Diffusers
            model classes remain upstream-owned; the adapter only resolves
            config, checkpoint, and condition-model contracts.
